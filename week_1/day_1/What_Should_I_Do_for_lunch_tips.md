### Tips
Try experimenting with the comparison operators ('>' '<' '===') and so on,using node REPL. Which can be opened using the 'node' command in vagrant
Work on code iteratively (AKA in small pieces).
to help you figure out how to use 'hungry' and "availableTime" in your function, try outputting their values to the terminal as follows 

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("available time is", availableTime);
}
